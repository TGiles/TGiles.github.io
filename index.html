                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am a graduate from <a href="http://cnu.edu/">Christopher Newport University</a> with a
                        B.S. ('16) and M.S. ('18) (Thesis) in Computer Science.
                        I create products that users want and enjoy using.
                        I make other developers more effective by supporting DevOps in an organization.
                        I solve business problems using proper software engineering principles.
                        I also implement these principles in an organization.
                        Personally, I am a believer in the Agile methodology and is something I like to bring to organizations.
                        I contribute to open source when possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For whatever reason, I decided to write a thesis in a field that I had zero experience in. My
                        thesis has to be the most challenging thing I have done to date. Because of this thesis, I now
                        understand robotics better as well as the tools and frameworks that roboticists
                        use to create applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have worked as a full stack developer, software engineer, graduate lab assistant, tutor, and
                        tech camp instructor across eight years. I enjoy learning exciting and relevant technologies,
                        and automation processes. Thanks to my Master's Thesis, I learned that I
                        enjoy robotics and AI, at least from a software perspective. Additionally, I had to learn ROS
                        (Robot Operating System) in order to fully implement my Thesis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have been in a few bands over the years, playing drums or bass. The most recent band I was in
                        is <a href="https://downhaul.bandcamp.com/">DOWNHAUL.</a> They are an excellent group of guys
                        that make killer indie rock/emo music,
                        if that's your thing. On the other side of creativity, I enjoy photography and creating
                        interesting shots. I currently use a Nikon D3300 with 35mm, 18-55mm, and 55-300mm lenses.
                        Some of my shots can be seen on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/121209804@N07">Flickr</a>.

                    <p>
                        One day I'd like to own and run a record label.
                        I spend way too much time listening and curating music, so the idea makes sense after getting more business experience.

                <h3><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/auto-lighthouse">auto-lighthouse</a></h3>
                <p>
                    My most recent project is a NPM package called auto-lighthouse.
                    I needed to audit many different web pages under a certain domain, but didn't have a straightforward way to accomplish this goal.
                    This is where auto-lighthouse comes into play.
                    It allows me to crawl a web domain, generate, and view the resulting
                    <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/">Google Lighthouse</a> reports.
                    Since Lighthouse uses <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/">axe</a> under the hood, I avoid second guessing the results of the accessibility audit.
                    As a bonus, I get all the other metrics from the Lighthouse report as well!
                </p>
                <h3><a href="https://github.com/TGiles/TGiles.github.io/blob/master/Tim-Giles-Thesis.pdf">Master's Thesis</a></h3>
                <p>
                    The gist, there was a fundamental bug in <a href="https://github.com/team-vigir">Team ViGIR's</a>
                    open-source footstep planner that I fixed. Because of this fix, the planner performs as expected
                    and generates footstep plans in an
                    appropriate amount of time. Additionally, my thesis advisor and I discovered other issues in the
                    planner that, when solved, will contribute a significant amount of progress to the current
                    open-source implementation.
                </p>
                <h3><a href="https://github.com/TGiles/capstone">Undergraduate Capstone</a></h3>
                <p>
                    The gist, create an academic gatekeeping application using physics papers. In detail, I wanted to
                    create a data visualization project using D3js as the main tool. I ended up using JavaScript, Java,
                    PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap3, and D3js
                    to create the entire project. The end result is a force-directed graph that shows citation
                    relationships between papers. This allows a user to visually see which papers are important in a
                    citation network.
